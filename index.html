      <h2>Our Polishes</h2>
      <p>We’re perfecting our first collection of flavors. Here are a few you can look forward to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strawberry Bliss</strong> – sweet and juicy, with a hint of berry aroma.</li>
        <li><strong>Minty Fresh</strong> – cool, refreshing and a little tingle on the tongue.</li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate Indulgence</strong> – rich cocoa notes for decadent nights.</li>
        <li><em>More flavors coming soon…</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each polish is formulated to be lickable and safe, perfect for exploring your foot fantasies.  We avoid harsh chemicals like formaldehyde, toluene and phthalates, using plant‑based film formers, natural colourants and food‑grade extracts.  Because our polishes are preservative‑free, they should be refrigerated and used within two months of opening.

      <h2>The TastyToes Experience</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>TastyToes</strong> isn’t just about nail color — it’s about awakening your senses and satisfying your fantasies.  Use the brush as foreplay: paint their toes during an intimate evening, leave a trail of flavour for them to trace with their tongue, or savour the taste yourself when you’re craving something naughty.  Our formulas dry quickly to a glossy finish, releasing a seductive aroma and flavour that begs to be licked.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a group of high‑school friends with a passion for beauty, chemistry and entrepreneurship.  Fascinated by the idea of combining nail polish with flavour, we set out to create <strong>TastyToes</strong>.  What began as a quirky idea has become a mission to help adults explore their foot fetishes in a fun, safe way.  Our goal is to bring couples closer and turn foot care into an erotic adventure.
